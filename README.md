Instructions to launch the backend are in the README.

## 2. Frontend installation

After you clone this repository, you can run `npm install` to initialize your project and dependencies.

You can switch between **API data** and **mocked data** in the app.
To switch, go in the _.env_ file and change the `REACT_APP_MOCKED_DATA` variable.

#### Then in the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
